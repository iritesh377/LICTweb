                                          out from Nepal in search of quality education to India and other countries
                                          every year. There are Nepalese who have the capacity to run high quality
                                          educational institution in Nepal itself. Lumbini ICT Campus paves
                                          international quality education at an affordable cost. Proper development of
                                          both head and heart leads an individual towards sustainable fast growth in
                                          career and life. For that, every student needs an environment conducive to
                                          self-learning with team work, nurturing and guidance by experienced mentors
                                          and lecturers. Recognizing this fact, we have designed and launched many
                                          innovative activity oriented student-centered talent development programs for
                                          our students to ensure their wholehearted involvement. In fact, many of our
                                          activities and events are initiated and managed by the students themselves.
                                          This enriches the students’ team work abilities and project management skill
